Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is seeking to review their infrastructure related to web security and implement modernized communication solutions to prevent attackers or other external forces from obtaining information or data. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I feel like I adequately highlighted Artemis Financials' vulnerabilities well and presented them with knowledge and information on how to maintain and improve their software security.  It is important to code securely because this ensures safety when developing applications and coding securely will help prevent having to go back to fix or change poorly written code.  Given that Artemis Financials' deals with financial information, this entails multiple layers of personal information.  It would not be beneficial for the company to have compromised communications.  If the company constantly fell victim to attacks and lost sensitive data each time, this would ruin their reputation and it would have a negative effect for their consumers and future business. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
It is helpful that there are tools that can scan code and notify developers of risks and vulnerabilities.  However, it is challenging to deal with "false-positive" vulnerabilities.  

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I approached this with an open mind and viewed the task with different perspectives to assess what they currently had secure or not secure.  I would continually use static testing and test frequently while ensuring that other tachniques, such as the use of HTTPS over HTTP, were used.  I will constantly reference vulnerability databases as well to stay abreast of new information.  I will continue to use and reference the Vulnerability Assessment Porcess flow chart and employ standard security practices in my code.  

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Test, review, run, analyze results and repeat until there are no errors or issues.  I used an iterative approach to ensure safety and proper code was developed.  When correcting an issue the first time, other problems may arise so it is important to review changes and test them again.  Vulnerability databases, secure coding guidelines and other practices will help me in future tasks and assignments.  

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
The ability to assess an application and take an iterative approach to develop a plan to adequately meet the goals for the company or assignment.  Furthermore, once laying the groundwork for completing the task, moving forward and successfully completing the task and producing error free results.
